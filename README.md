- 👋 Hi, I’m Nate M
- 👀 I’m interested in: Engineering and R&D of cutting edge Energy production methods. Professionally, I studied at the Rochester Institute of technology (RIT).
-I'm very goal oriented and focused on ME, no I'm not talking about myself, I'm talking about mechanical engineering 😝. i chose the energy energy option, and minored in mathematics. later on I am wanted to develop projects so I learned a lot of electrical engineering and then wanted to do some programming so I wanted to teach so I started teaching myself Java 🤦🏻‍♂️, but it's not really a good first language to learn so I quickly switched to Python, because not only is it easier, but its better with math, physics, ML, and AI, which if you asked me last year, I would've said AI has alot of work to go before it would be halfway decent, but in the last few months, I completely take that back and think it's fascinating!.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with, someone who has a background with python and is good at CAD and or 3-D printing because I have inventions that I have yet to patent and would love some help.
